Writeup for CVE-2020-29669 
by Maximilian Barz (Silky) and Daniel Schwendner (code-byter)

==========================

This is a writeup of exploiting the Macally WIFISD2-2A82 Travel Router (Firmware version: 2.000.010). The Guest user is able to reset its own password. This process has a vulnerability which can be used to take over the administrators account and results in shell access. As the admin user may read the /etc/shadow file, the password hashes of each user (including root) can be dumped. The root hash can be cracked easily which results in a complete system compromise. All this from the guest account which is meant to be given to guests.
